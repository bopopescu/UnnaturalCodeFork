class LPForkingService(object):
    """A service that can be asked to start a new bzr subprocess via fork.

    The basic idea is that bootstrapping time is long. Most of this is time
    spent during import of all needed libraries (lp.*).  For example, the
    original 'lp-serve' command could take 2.5s just to start up, before any
    actual actions could be performed.

    This class provides a service sitting on a socket, which can then be
    requested to fork and run a given bzr command.

    Clients connect to the socket and make a single request, which then
    receives a response. The possible requests are:

        "hello\n":  Trigger a heartbeat to report that the program is still
                    running, and write status information to the log file.
        "quit\n":   Stop the service, but do so 'nicely', waiting for children
                    to exit, etc. Once this is received the service will stop
                    taking new requests on the port.
        "fork-env <command>\n<env>\nend\n": Request a new subprocess to be
            started.  <command> is the bzr command to be run, such as "rocks"
            or "lp-serve --inet 12".
            The immediate response will be the path-on-disk to a directory
            full of named pipes (fifos) that will be the stdout/stderr/stdin
            (named accordingly) of the new process.
            If a client holds the socket open, when the child process exits,
            the exit status (as given by 'wait()') will be written to the
            socket.

            Note that one of the key bits is that the client will not be
            started with exec*, we just call 'commands.run_bzr*()' directly.
            This way, any modules that are already loaded will not need to be
            loaded again. However, care must be taken with any global-state
            that should be reset.

            fork-env allows you to supply environment variables such as
            "BZR_EMAIL: joe@foo.com" which will be set in os.environ before
            the command is run.
    """

    # Design decisions. These are bits where we could have chosen a different
    # method/implementation and weren't sure what would be best. Documenting
    # the current decision, and the alternatives.
    #
    # [Decision #1]
    #   Serve on a named AF_UNIX socket.
    #       1) It doesn't make sense to serve to arbitrary hosts, we only want
    #          the local host to make requests. (Since the client needs to
    #          access the named fifos on the current filesystem.)
    #       2) You can set security parameters on a filesystem path (g+rw,
    #          a-rw).
    # [Decision #2]
    #   SIGCHLD
    #       We want to quickly detect that children have exited so that we can
    #       inform the client process quickly. At the moment, we register a
    #       SIGCHLD handler that doesn't do anything. However, it means that
    #       when we get the signal, if we are currently blocked in something
    #       like '.accept()', we will jump out temporarily. At that point the
    #       main loop will check if any children have exited. We could have
    #       done this work as part of the signal handler, but that felt 'racy'
    #       doing any serious work in a signal handler.
    #       If we just used socket.timeout as the indicator to go poll for
    #       children exiting, it slows the disconnect by as much as the full
    #       timeout. (So a timeout of 1.0s will cause the process to hang by
    #       that long until it determines that a child has exited, and can
    #       close the connection.)
    #       The current flow means that we'll notice exited children whenever
    #       we finish the current work.
    # [Decision #3]
    #   Child vs Parent actions.
    #       There are several actions that are done when we get a new request.
    #       We have to create the fifos on disk, fork a new child, connect the
    #       child to those handles, and inform the client of the new path (not
    #       necessarily in that order.) It makes sense to wait to send the
    #       path message until after the fifos have been created. That way the
    #       client can just try to open them immediately, and the
    #       client-and-child will be synchronized by the open() calls.
    #       However, should the client be the one doing the mkfifo, should the
    #       server? Who should be sending the message? Should we fork after
    #       the mkfifo or before?
    #       The current thoughts:
    #           1) Try to do work in the child when possible. This should
    #              allow for 'scaling' because the server is single-threaded.
    #           2) We create the directory itself in the server, because that
    #              allows the server to monitor whether the client failed to
    #              clean up after itself or not.
    #           3) Otherwise we create the fifos in the client, and then send
    #              the message back.
    # [Decision #4]
    #   Exit information
    #       Inform the client that the child has exited on the socket they
    #       used to request the fork.
    #       1) Arguably they could see that stdout and stderr have been
    #          closed, and thus stop reading. In testing, I wrote a client
    #          which uses select.poll() over stdin/stdout/stderr and used that
    #          to ferry the content to the appropriate local handle. However
    #          for the FIFOs, when the remote end closed, I wouldn't see any
    #          corresponding information on the local end. There obviously
    #          wasn't any data to be read, so they wouldn't show up as
    #          'readable' (for me to try to read, and get 0 bytes, indicating
    #          it was closed). I also wasn't seeing POLLHUP, which seemed to
    #          be the correct indicator.  As such, we decided to inform the
    #          client on the socket that they originally made the fork
    #          request, rather than just closing the socket immediately.
    #       2) We could have had the forking server close the socket, and only
    #          the child hold the socket open. When the child exits, then the
    #          OS naturally closes the socket.
    #          If we want the returncode, then we should put that as bytes on
    #          the socket before we exit. Having the child do the work means
    #          that in error conditions, it could easily die before being able
    #          to write anything (think SEGFAULT, etc). The forking server is
    #          already 'wait'() ing on its children. So that we don't get
    #          zombies, and with wait3() we can get the rusage (user time,
    #          memory consumption, etc.)
    #          As such, it seems reasonable that the server can then also
    #          report back when a child is seen as exiting.
    # [Decision #5]
    #   cleanup once connected
    #       The child process blocks during 'open()' waiting for the client to
    #       connect to its fifos. Once the client has connected, the child
    #       then deletes the temporary directory and the fifos from disk. This
    #       means that there isn't much left for diagnosis, but it also means
    #       that the client won't leave garbage around if it crashes, etc.
    #       Note that the forking service itself still monitors the paths
    #       created, and will delete garbage if it sees that a child failed to
    #       do so.
    # [Decision #6]
    #   os._exit(retcode) in the child
    #       Calling sys.exit(retcode) raises an exception, which then bubbles
    #       up the stack and runs exit functions (and finally statements).
    #       When I tried using it originally, I would see the current child
    #       bubble all the way up the stack (through the server code that it
    #       fork() through), and then get to main() returning code 0. The
    #       process would still exit nonzero. My guess is that something in
    #       the atexit functions was failing, but that it was happening after
    #       logging, etc had been shut down.
    #       Any global state from the child process should be flushed before
    #       run_bzr_* has exited (which we *do* wait for), and any other
    #       global state is probably a remnant from the service process. Which
    #       will be cleaned up by the service itself, rather than the child.
    #       There is some concern that log files may not get flushed, so we
    #       currently call sys.exitfunc() first. The main problem is that I
    #       don't know any way to *remove* a function registered via
    #       'atexit()' so if the forking service has some state, we my try to
    #       clean it up incorrectly.
    #       Note that the bzr script itself uses sys.exitfunc(); os._exit() in
    #       the 'bzr' main script, as the teardown time of all the python
    #       state was quite noticeable in real-world runtime. As such, bzrlib
    #       should be pretty safe, or it would have been failing for people
    #       already.
    # [Decision #7]
    #   prefork vs max children vs ?
    #       For simplicity it seemed easiest to just fork when requested. Over
    #       time, I realized it would be easy to allow running an arbitrary
    #       command (no harder than just running one command), so it seemed
    #       reasonable to switch over. If we go the prefork route, then we'll
    #       need a way to tell the pre-forked children what command to run.
    #       This could be as easy as just adding one more fifo that they wait
    #       on in the same directory.
    #       For now, I've chosen not to limit the number of forked children. I
    #       don't know what a reasonable value is, and probably there are
    #       already limitations at play. (If Conch limits connections, then it
    #       will already be doing all the work, etc.)
    # [Decision #8]
    #   nicer errors on the request socket
    #       This service is meant to be run only on the local system. As such,
    #       we don't try to be extra defensive about leaking information to
    #       the one connecting to the socket. (We should still watch out what
    #       we send across the per-child fifos, since those are connected to
    #       remote clients.) Instead we try to be helpful, and tell them as
    #       much as we know about what went wrong.
