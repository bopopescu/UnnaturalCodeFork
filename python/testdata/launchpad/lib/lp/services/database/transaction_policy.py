class DatabaseTransactionPolicy:
    """Context manager for read-only transaction policy.

    Use this to define regions of code that explicitly allow or disallow
    changes to the database:

        # We want to be sure that inspect_data does not inadvertently
        # make any changes in the database, but we can't run it on the
        # subordinate store because it doesn't tolerate replication lag.
        with DatabaseTransactionPolicy(read_only=True):
            inspect_data()

    The simplest way to use this is as a special transaction:
     * You must commit/abort before entering the policy.
     * Exiting the policy through an exception aborts its changes.
     * Before completing a read-write policy region, you must commit or abort.

    You can also have multiple transactions inside one policy, however; the
    policy still applies after a commit or abort.

    Policies can be nested--a nested policy overrides the one it's nested in.
    After the nested policy has exited, the previous policy applies again:

        # This code needs to control the database changes it makes very
        # carefully.  Most of it is just gathering data, with one quick
        # database update at the end.
        with DatabaseTransactionPolicy(read_only=True):
            data = gather_data()
            more_data = figure_stuff_out(data)

            # End the ongoing transaction so we can go into our update.
            transaction.commit()
