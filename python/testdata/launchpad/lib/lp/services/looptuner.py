    """A loop that tunes itself to approximate an ideal time per iteration.

    Use this for large processing jobs that need to be broken down into chunks
    of such size that processing a single chunk takes approximately a given
    ideal time.  For example, large database operations may have to be
    performed and committed in a large number of small steps in order to avoid
    locking out other clients that need to access the same data.  Regular
    commits allow other clients to get their work done.

    In such a situation, committing for every step is often far too costly.
    Imagine inserting a million rows and committing after every row!  You
    could hand-pick a static number of steps per commit, but that takes a lot
    of experimental guesswork and it will still waste time when things go
    well, and on the other hand, it will still end up taking too much time per
    batch when the system slows down for whatever reason.

    Instead, define your loop body in an ITunableLoop; parameterize it on the
    number of steps per batch; say how much time you'd like to spend per
    batch; and pass it to a LoopTuner.  The LoopTuner will execute your loop,
    dynamically tuning its batch-size parameter to stay close to your time
    goal.  If things go faster than expected, it will ask your loop body to do
    more work for the next batch.  If a batch takes too much time, the next
    batch will be smaller.  There is also some cushioning for one-off spikes
    and troughs in processing speed.

        goal_seconds: the ideal number of seconds for any one iteration to

            operation runs.  Defaults to None for no sleep.
