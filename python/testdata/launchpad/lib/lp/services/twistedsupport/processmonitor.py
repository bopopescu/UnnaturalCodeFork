    """Support for running a process and reporting on its progress.

    The idea is this: you want to run a child process.  Occasionally, you want
    to report on what it is doing to some other entity: maybe it's a multistep
    task and you want to update a row in a database to reflect which step it
    is currently on.  This class provides a runNotification() method that
    helps with this, taking a callable that performs this notfication, maybe
    returning a deferred.

    Design decisions:

     - The notifications are serialized.  If you call runNotification() with
       two callables, the deferred returned by the first must fire before the
       second callable will be called.

     - A notification failing is treated as a fatal error: the child process
       is killed and the 'termination deferred' fired.

     - Because there are multiple things that can go wrong more-or-less at
       once (the process can exit with an error condition at the same time as
       unexpectedError is called for some reason), we take the policy of
       reporting the first thing that we notice going wrong to the termination
       deferred and log.err()ing the others.

     - The deferred passed into the constructor will not be fired until the
       child process has exited and all pending notifications have completed.
       Note that Twisted does not tell us the process has exited until all of
       it's output has been processed.

    :ivar _deferred: The deferred that will be fired when the child process
        exits.
    :ivar _notification_lock: A DeferredLock, used to serialize the
        notifications.
    :ivar _termination_failure: When we kill the child process in response to
        some unexpected error, we report the reason we killed it to
        self._deferred, not that it exited because we killed it.
