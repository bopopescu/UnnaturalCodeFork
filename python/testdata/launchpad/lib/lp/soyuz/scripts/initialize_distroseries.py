    """Copy in all of the parents distroseries's configuration. This
    includes all configuration for distroseries as well as distroarchseries,
    publishing and all publishing records for sources and binaries.

    We support 2 use cases here:
      #1 If the child distribution has zero initialized series:
        - the parent list can't be empty (otherwise we trigger an error);
        - the series will be derived from the parents passed as argument;
        - the parents will be set to the parents passed as argument;
        - first_derivation = True.
      #2 If the child distribution has more than zero initialized series:
        - the series will be derived from the previous_series;
        - the parents will be set to the parents passed as argument or
          the parents of the previous_series if the passed argument is empty;
        - first_derivation = False.

    Preconditions:
      The distroseries must exist, and be completly unused, with no source
      or binary packages existing, as well as no distroarchseries set up.
      Section and component selections must be empty. It must not have any
      parent series.

    Outcome:
      The distroarchseries set up in the parent series will be copied.
      The publishing structure will be copied from the parents. All
      PUBLISHED and PENDING packages in the parents will be created in
      this distroseries and its distroarchseriess. All component and section
      selections will be duplicated, as will any permission-related
      structures.

    Note:
      This method will raise a InitializationError when the pre-conditions
      are not met. After this is run, you still need to construct chroots
      for building, you need to add anything missing wrt. ports etc. This
      method is only meant to give you a basic copy of parent series in
      order to assist you in preparing a new series of a distribution or
      in the initialization of a derivative.
